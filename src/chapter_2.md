# Chapter 2: Godot Beginnings
Us programmers have the important role of creating Game Objects, or "toys", for
the game designers to play with. In this tutorial we will make a simple toy and
demonstrate how to play with it in the Godot editor.

Please watch [this](https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?si=9OEUZUkWWFVwaBG2). The
content contained within will be used for the next module as well. This will
cover all the material we will use for working with Godot in WGS.

If you haven't already installed Godot, you can do that
[here](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/).

## 2.1: What to turn in:

The next tutorial will have you creating a 2D platformer. To complete this
module, create a new node that's controlled by the arrow keys on your keyboard.
The simplest way to do this would be duplicating the node we just created while
only changing the script we made. Then, change the behavior of the new player
somehow (maybe it could speed up the longer you hold the movement down, or it
could gradually accelerate instead of immediately moving and then stop
accelerating once a target speed is hit.) Whatever you do, explain its behavior
somewhere in your submission.

The preferred method for submitting this project would be creating a git
repository for what you create (or reusing an old one) and hosting it on
github. You can then send the Programming director the link to the github page.
Using Github would allow for pull requests and issues which would optimize
feedback. Alternatively, you can email the current Programming director a zip
file containing your project. You can find the email for the current director
in the [home page](./index.md).
